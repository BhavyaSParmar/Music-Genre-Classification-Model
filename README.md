This Python script demonstrates the use of **NumPy**, a powerful library for numerical computing. It focuses on array manipulation, mathematical operations, and memory efficiency, showcasing key functionalities that are essential in data analysis and scientific computing.

### **Core Operations**:
1. **Array Creation and Manipulation**:
   - Converts Python lists into **NumPy arrays** and creates multi-dimensional arrays, including 2D and 3D structures.
   - Example: Reshaping a list into a 3x2 matrix and generating random 3D arrays.

2. **Statistical Operations**:
   - Performs arithmetic calculations like finding the **mean**, **minimum**, and **maximum** values.
   - Example: Calculating the mean of an array of even numbers between 2 and 100.

3. **Array Reshaping and Slicing**:
   - Demonstrates how to reshape arrays into different dimensions for tasks like matrix operations.
   - Example: Reshaping a sequence into a 3x4 array.

4. **Memory Size Calculation**:
   - Shows how to calculate the **memory size** of arrays, which is important when handling large datasets.
   - Example: Computing the memory size of a 10x10 array of random values.

5. **Generating Sequences and Patterns**:
   - Generates arrays with custom sequences, such as fixed step sizes, useful for simulations and data preparation.
   - Example: Creating an array starting from 5 with a step of 3.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **NumPy**: The core library used for array manipulation, mathematical operations, and memory management.

This script demonstrates essential **NumPy** operations, including array creation, reshaping, statistical analysis, and memory optimization. These tasks are foundational for data science, machine learning, and numerical computing.
